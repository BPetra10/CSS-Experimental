            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                As a certified Project Manager, I've spent five years guiding technology projects from the drawing board
                through to successful launch. I move flexibly between Agile (Scrum/Kanban) and traditional methods
                (Waterfall), always choosing what works best for the team. My focus is on clear communication and
                ensuring processes keep moving without unnecessary halts. I enjoy working under pressure with tight
                deadlines and budgets. I love leading cross-functional teams, catching problems early, and making sure
                every stakeholder is informed.
